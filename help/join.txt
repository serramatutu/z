z join

summary:
    join an array of strings into a string

    "join" commands are used anywhere after a "split" command.
        1. transform input contents into array with "split"
        2. map the array elements using other commands such as "hash", "replace" or "length"
        3. join the array back into a string implicitly with "\n" or using "join"

    split arrays with no closing join are implicitly joined with "\n"

usage:
    z join [<delimiter>]

parameters:
    <delimiter> optional. default is "\n"
        the string to be used as delimiter.

examples:
    # get the lengths of all lines in a file and join them with "\n" (implicit join)
    z split _ length

    # get the lengths of all lines in a file and join them with ","
    z split _ length _ join ,
