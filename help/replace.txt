z replace

summary:
    find occurrences of a pattern/substring and replace them with a substring

usage:
    z replace <string-or-pattern> [<replace-string>] [<occurrence-range>]

parameters:
    <string-or-pattern> mandatory
        the string or regular expression pattern to be matched. Patterns are enclosed with //.

    <replace-string> optional. default is ""
        the string that will replace the matches

    <occurrence-range> optional. default is ":"
        the half-open match index range where replacement will occur.
        if range end is negative, counts in reverse order beginning from the last.

examples:
    # splitting by ":" (a.k.a replacing ":" by "\n")
    z replace : \n

    # removing all ":"
    z replace :

    # replacing all alphabetical characters with "0"
    z replace /[A-z]/ 0

    # replacing all but first "0" with "zero"
    z replace 0 "zero" 1:

    # replacing all but first and last "1" with "one"
    z replace 0 "zero" 1:-1

    # removing the first "."
    z replace . "" 0:1
