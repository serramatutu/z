z hash

summary:
    hash a string according to an algorithm

usage:
    z hash <algorithm>

parameters:
    <algorithm> mandatory. must be one of (md5, sha1, sha224, sha256)
        which algorithm to use for hashing.
        md5 and sha1 are not cryptographically secure and should not be used for secure applications.

examples:
    # hash a string with md5
    z hash md5

    # hash a string with sha1
    z hash sha1

    # hash a string with sha256
    z hash sha256
