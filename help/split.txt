z split

summary:
    split a string into an array of strings

    usually, split is used together with other commands in the following order
        1. transform input contents into array with "split"
        2. map the array elements using other commands such as "hash", "replace" or "length"
        3. join the array back into a string implicitly with "\n" or using "join"

usage:
    z split [<delimiter>]

parameters:
    <delimiter> optional. default is "\n"
        the string or regular expression pattern to be used as delimiter. Patterns are enclosed with //.

examples:
    # splitting by ":"
    z split :

    # splitting by whitespace character groups
    z split /(\s)+/

    # get the length of all strings between ":"
    z split : _ length

    # get the md5 of every line in a file and join them by "\n"
    z split _ hash md5

    # get the md5 the whole file (notice how the absence of "split" changes behavior)
    z hash md5

    # get the lengths of all lines in a file and join them with ","
    z split _ length _ join ,
