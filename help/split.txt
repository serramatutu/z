z split

summary:
    split a string into an array of strings

    "split" is used together with other commands in the following order
        1. transform input contents into array with "split"
        2. map the array elements using other commands such as "hash", "replace" or "length"
        3. join the array back into a string by concatenating its entries implicitly or by using "join"

usage:
    z split [<delimiter>]

parameters:
    <delimiter> optional. default is "\n"
        the string or regular expression pattern to be used as delimiter. Patterns are enclosed with //.

examples:
    # splitting by ":"
    z split :

    # splitting by whitespace character groups
    z split /(\s)+/

    # get the lengths of all strings between ":" and concatenate them
    z split : _ length

    # get the md5 of every line in a file and concatenate them
    z split _ hash md5

    # get the md5 the whole file (notice how the absence of "split" changes behavior)
    z hash md5

    # get the lengths of all lines in a file and join them with ","
    z split _ length _ join ,
