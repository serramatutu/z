      enum:
        - ...commands
      description: Which subcommand to run.

- cmd: join
  link: /docs/commands/join/
  description: |
    Join an array of strings into a string.

    "join" commands are used anywhere after a "split" command.
      1. transform input contents into array with "split"
      2. map the array elements using other commands such as "hash", "replace" or "length"
      3. join the array back into a string by concatenating its entries implicitly or by using "join"

    Split arrays with no closing join have their elements implicitly concatenated.
  arguments:
    - name: delimiter
      optional: true
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: The string to be used as delimiter.

- cmd: length
  link: /docs/commands/length/
  description: Measure the length of a string

- cmd: replace
  link: /docs/commands/replace/
  description: Find occurrences of a pattern and replace them with a string.
  arguments:
    - name: pattern
      optional: false
      type: pattern
      description: The regular expression pattern to be matched.
    - name: replace-string
      optional: false
      type: string
      description: The string that will replace the matches.
    - name: replace-string
      optional: false
      type: string
      default: "0:0"
      description: >
        The half-open match index range where replacement will occur.
        Negative range end means counting in reverse order.
        Zero range end means last match.

- cmd: split
  link: /docs/commands/split/
  description: |
    Split a string into an array of strings.

    "split" is used together with other commands in the following order
        1. transform input contents into array with "split"
        2. map the array elements using other commands such as "hash", "replace" or "length"
        3. join the array back into a string by concatenating its entries implicitly or by using "join"
  arguments:
    - name: delimiter
      optional: true
      default: "\n"
      type: pattern
