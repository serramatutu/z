    join an array of strings into a string

    "join" commands are used anywhere after a "split" command.
      1. transform input contents into array with "split"
      2. map the array elements using other commands such as "hash", "replace" or "length"
      3. join the array back into a string by concatenating its entries implicitly or by using "join"

    split arrays with no closing join have their elements implicitly concatenated

  arguments:
    - name: delimiter
      optional: true
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: the string to be used as delimiter.
